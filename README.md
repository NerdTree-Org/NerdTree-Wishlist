# NerdTree-Wishlist
#### NerdTree is coming soon! This repo is a wishlist for what will be added to NerdTree.

## What is NerdTree? Is it just another tech community from Bangladesh?
NerdTree is an open environment, activity focused, place of opportunities for mainly school and college level students of Bangladesh. The name “NerdTree” derives from the concept of a tree (in graph theory), where every member (aka “Nerd”) is considered to be a node and the edges (connections) between them make the whole thing a "NerdTree". This idea is powerful, robust, fault-tolerant and expandable in many extents, making NerdTree a well-structured community.

## Who runs NerdTree?
NerdTree is run by a reliable group of young tech enthusiasts with different backgrounds and skillsets, advised by a senior advisor panel and a bunch of well-wishers as well :D

## How NerdTree will work
NerdTree will have a website where ~~only students~~ anyone can register. After completing the registration process, they will be added to a discussion group where they can talk about technology, programming etc. NerdTree will have a big community where we will host regular programming contests, quiz competitions, workshops etc. NerdTree will encourage it's members to contribute to open source projects. Thus increasing their knowledge of collaborative working.

## Our Mission

NerdTree has a set of missions to accomplish.

A lot of tech communities are growing too fast in Bangladesh. However, we’ve always felt that something is missing in most of these communities. Clickbait, spam, and false information make them unqualified and misleading. NerdTree is a silent protest against the misleading ones, aiming to be what a “tech community” should be.


## How do I make suggestion for adding something?
Create an Issue in this repo! It's that simple :)
Our "Root Nodes" will talk about that with you.
